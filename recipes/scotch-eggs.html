    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scotch eggs are a classic British dish consisting of a hard or soft-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried or baked. They are often served as a snack or picnic food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) sausage meat</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried herbs (optional)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (if deep-frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the eggs in water for about 6-8 minutes for soft-boiled or 10-12 minutes for hard-boiled. Cool them in ice water and peel.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the sausage meat with salt, pepper, and herbs (if using).</li>
        <li>Divide the sausage meat into four equal portions. Flatten each portion into a patty.</li>
        <li>Wrap each boiled egg with a sausage patty, ensuring it is completely covered.</li>
        <li>Dredge each wrapped egg in flour, then dip in beaten egg, and finally coat with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350째F (175째C). Fry the eggs until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Alternatively, bake at 400째F (200째C) for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels and let cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
